# Fine fractals zoom videos

### Java project to make fine fractal zoom videos

## Finebrot

When calculating fine fractals we are interested in all intermediate calculation results.  
All these intermediate results form a **calculation path**.

This program computes at least one calculation path for each pixel.

All these **calculation paths together** are what makes the **Finebrot fractal**.

A mathematician might call generated Finebrot an **orbital density map**

## Mandelbrot

Represents Mandelbrot fractal, it is used to maintain interesting points for fine fractal calculation.

All the interesting points are at the horizon of Mandelbrot set.

In Mandelbrot window, they are shown in `red` color.

## Variables

`px`, `py` - numbers represent `int` x,y coordinates of screen pixels

`re`, `im` - numbers represent `double` x,y coordinates (point), located in the center of a pixel

`m` - carrier object for effective calculation

## Mandelbrot calculation

For each pixel `px`,`py`, take point in the center of that pixel `re`,`im`, call it **origin**.

Start calculation shown below, and repeat it, for at most `ITERATION_MAX` times or until the calculation result
diverges.

> re -> (re * re) - (im * im) + originRe  
> im -> 2 * re * im + originIm

During the repeated calculation, point `re, im` jumps around in spirals,  
`originRe`, and `originIm` are constant.

In deliberately confusing terminology of complex numbers

> z -> z<sup>2</sup> + c

Where c is a constant, which is different for each calculation origin, and z<sub>0</sub> = c<sub>0</sub>

Divergent calculation means that quadrance of values `re`, `im` is more then `CALCULATION_BOUNDARY = 4`,  
If that happens, repeating calculation would only increase values `re`, `im` very fast and wouldn't add any points to
desired image.

### To make a classic image of Mandelbrot set

Count how many iteration it took, for the calculation to diverge.

Pixels, for which the calculation didn't diverge, that is `ITERATION_MAX` was reached, those color **black**.

Those pixels for which the calculation diverged after at least `ITERATION_min`, but before `ITERATION_MAX`
calculation iterations, those color with various **bright colors**.

## Finebrot calculation

Calculation is the same

> re -> (re * re) - (im * im) + originRe  
> im -> 2 * re * im + originIm

![Infinite Finebrot](src/main/resources/images/Infinite-Finebrot.jpg)

but we are interested in each point of the **calculation path**.

That is calculation `path`, represented as `ArrayList<double[]> path`

### To make an image

For each path element [re<sub>i</sub>, im<sub>i</sub>] increase value of corresponding pixel by one.

Color the resulting values by **decent colors**.

## CPUs utilization

All mathematical calculations happen in `CalculationPathThread` which computes calculation paths for
each `MandelbrotElement`

`ExecutorService` uses N-1 CPU cores.

It takes only seconds to generate decent image or video frame on good CPU.

Full zoom video or 10k resolution image may take 24h+

## GPU utilization

In `fine.fractals.gpgpu` is used JOCL library using OpenCL kernel code to compute calculation paths on GPU.  
It is necessary to have OpenCL runtime installed.

http://www.jocl.org

## Memory consumption

Finebrot fractal is held in computer memory as individual calculation paths.

All calculation paths are held in memory because as the zoom progresses,   
path elements re<sub>i</sub>, im<sub>i</sub> move to new screen pixels xp, py.

Path elements `re`, `im` which move out of the screen boundary are removed.

It is recommended to have 16GB RAM or generate images in smaller resolution.

To save memory use `RESOLUTION_MULTIPLIER = none`.

## How to make Video from images with sound

In package `fine.fractals.tools.video` is ready to use `ListOfImagesToVideoWithAudio`

Which will combine generated list of images with audio file to make a video.

Edit constants annotated with `@EditMe` to point to your image directory and audio file.

Library used to generate video with sound in Java is `org.bytedeco.ffmpeg`

## Application overview

`fine.fractals`

Root package contains classes representing specific fine fractals.

These classes contain the relevant equation `math()` and all the relevant variables. Definitions of image resolution,
color palette, etc.

`fine.fractals.color`

Contains color palettes used to perfectly color generated Finebrot data into image.

`fine.fractals.fractal.finebrot`

Area - defines which part of Finebrot is displayed and calculated

Paths - holds all the calculation paths data `ArrayList<double[]> paths`

Pixels - holds the `double[]` data mapped to `int[][]` screen pixels

Packages `finite`, `infinite`, `euler`, `phoenix` contains implementations for various kinds of fractals this
application can calculate.

`fine.fractals.fractal.mandelbrot`

Area - defines domain for Finebrot calculation, all the interesting pints are at the horizon of Mandelbrot set.

Pixels - holds the Mandelbrot data `MandelbrotElement[RESOLUTION_WIDTH][RESOLUTION_HEIGHT]`    
Which contain relevant Mandelbrot pixel states. These states are important to optimize calculation.

`fine.fractals.machine`

`FractalEngine` - Fractal engine sequentially triggers the calculation and organizes relevant steps before and after the
calculation.  
It is the centre functional core of this program.

`CalculationPathThread` - Performs the actual calculations for `MandelbrotElements` and  
puts good results (calculation paths) in `PathsFinebrot`

`Target` - Represents point `re,im` at the center of displayed `AreaFinebrot` and `AreaMandelbrot`.   
Towards this point the application zooms

## How to use this application

* In IDE, navigate to any fine fractal in root package, for example `fine.fractals.Finebrot_Side`
* See the few constants which configure the application.
* Execute `main` method.

## Random ideas to do

Make fine fractal from Riemann Zeta function and zoom into -1/12

Redo area Mandelbrot, don't make it smaller each zoom, only recalculate `plank` and cut off area corners when elements
on far sides don't add any relevant data.

Optimize `ITERATION_MAX` and `ITERATION_min` by small finebrot chunks, not by the whole screen data.
